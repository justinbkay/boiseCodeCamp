=============

developer connection is a demo app to see some of the functionality of the Meteor.js framework.  It is heavily based on 
a tutorial on smashingmagazine.com http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/13/build-app-45-minutes-meteor/

It uses Twitter oauth to create an account for the user.  It then displays all of the users with a twitter follow button.

I added the ability to add a tagline to the users profile, which is displayed by their badge and follow button.
